        <p>&emsp;&emsp;My name's Jasper Bingham, and I'm a '17 from New York City.  I'm a software engineer, focusing on full-stack web development.
        Right now I'm working on two websites.  The first is a marketplace for Dartmouth students, which I'm building along with five other '17s
        as part of CS 98.  The second is <a href="http://improvedartmouth.com">Improve Dartmouth</a>, a Reddit-like site where members of the Dartmouth community
        can submit, upvote, downvote and discuss ideas on how to better our school.  (Some older students might remember Improve Dartmouth as it was really
        popular 2 years ago or so - I designed the new site!)  As for the tech stacks I'm working with, both sites have Django backends, and I'm using React/Redux
        and Angular for the frontends of the CS 98/Improve Dartmouth sites respectively.  Going forward, I'm looking to do side projects that focus on data visualization
        (likely with Uber's deck.gl package) and/or machine learning (hopefully with Google's Tensorflow).  Please shoot me an
        <a href="mailto:jasperbingham.17@dartmouth.edu">email</a> if you have any questions!
